Dash is a library for providing helper scripts, middleware, and analytics tools for monitoring applications. 

[[_TOC_]]

## Overview

There are three parts to Dash - consumable utilities, metric scripts, and documentation.

## Development Process

1. Modify or create new files in the directory: `src/main`

### Development Stack

- WebPack PreConfiged ot support multiple entries and outputs
- TypeScript 3.8
- Babel 7.9.0
- Jest Test Runner
- Prettier Auto Formatter
- ESLint Configuration

## Modules

- [Main](../src/main/README.md)
- [Analytics](../src/analytics/README.md)
- [DataLayer](../src/datalayer/README.md)

## Building the library

- Running `npm start` will continuously build this library, useful during development, while the library is linked to another project. \*Note: This does not build types.
- Running `npm run build` will build the library with types

## Linking during Development

1. You can link to a local copy of Dash by adding: `"@dtci/dash": "file:../dash"` to your package.json file, assuming dash lives one level up from the project you're testing.
2. cd my-app && npm link ../dash
3. cd ../dash && npm link ../my-app/node_modules/react
